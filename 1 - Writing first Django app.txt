1 - Writing first Django app
=============================
From the command line, cd into a directory where you’d like to store your code, then run the following command:

	$ django-admin startproject mysite
	
Let’s look at what startproject created:

	mysite/
		manage.py
		mysite/
			__init__.py
			settings.py
			urls.py
			asgi.py
			wsgi.py

The development server
-----------------------
Let’s verify your Django project works. Change into the outer mysite directory, if you haven’t already, and run the following commands:

	$ python manage.py runserver
	
Now that the server’s running, visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/ with your web browser. You’ll see a “Congratulations!” page, with a rocket taking off. It worked!

Creating the Polls app
------------------------
Projects vs. apps:

What’s the difference between a project and an app? An app is a web application that does something – e.g., a blog system, a database of public records or a small poll app. A project is a collection of configuration and apps for a particular website. A project can contain multiple apps. An app can be in multiple projects.

To create your app, make sure you’re in the same directory as manage.py and type this command:

	$ python manage.py startapp polls
	
That’ll create a directory polls, which is laid out like this:
	
	polls/
		__init__.py
		admin.py
		apps.py
		migrations/
			__init__.py
		models.py
		tests.py
		views.py
		

Write your first view
----------------------
	from django.http import HttpResponse

	def index(request):
		return HttpResponse("Hello, world. You're at the polls index.")

To define a URLconf for the polls app, create a file polls/urls.py with the following content:

	from django.urls import path

	from . import views

	urlpatterns = [
		path("", views.index, name="index"),
	]
	
The next step is to configure the global URLconf in the mysite project to include the URLconf defined in polls.urls. To do this, add an import for django.urls.include in mysite/urls.py and insert an include() in the urlpatterns list, so you have:

	from django.contrib import admin
	from django.urls import include, path

	urlpatterns = [
		path("polls/", include("polls.urls")),
		path("admin/", admin.site.urls),
	]
	
https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/
	
When to use include():

You should always use include() when you include other URL patterns. admin.site.urls is the only exception to this.

The path() function is passed four arguments, two required: route and view, and two optional: kwargs, and name. At this point, it’s worth reviewing what these arguments are for.


Summary
--------
Set up a Django virtual environment

Create project using this virtual environment

Spin up a development server

Create "Polls" app.

Creates a view in the Polls app and include it's configuration in the main mysite urls.py file/
